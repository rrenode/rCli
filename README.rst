rCli

    A simple cli lib because the others piss me off.


This one will likely piss you off too. For instance, I've yet to write my tests, documentation is severly lacking, there are glaring issues if I ever need to scale this; but that's okay. If it does piss you off, you can go and make your own, OR you can use one of the very many libs that exist out in this forsaken digital connection we call the internet.

Jokes aside, I wanted something very simple to parse cli arguments and creates commands and subcommands. It fits my use case and was designed soley for that purpose. If you find that it might fit your use case as well and find issues, feel free to open an issue here on GitHub and I'll set aside some time to fix it.

Documentation, unit tests, and build scripts to come. Cheers.
